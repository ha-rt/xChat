# xChat
An encrypted chatting app created in Python using Google Firebase.

## Want to create your own server on xChat?

Here are the steps to creating your own xChat server, and sharing it with friends! I ask that when creating servers, if you create new features please share them with the GitHub repository so we can get new amazing features added to xChat.

1 - Create a new file in the xChat main directory named "credentials.py".
2 - Open the new file, and type "FirebaseCredentials = {}".
3 - Get your Firebase JSON Credentials from Firebase, and open the JSON file.
4 - Paste the JSON data inside the brackets you created in the file.

5 - Create a new file inside the Encryption package named "Configuration.py"
6 - Inside the new file, type "ENCRYPTION_KEY = b''"
7 - Inside the string that you just created, paste in a Fernet viable encryption key (https://pythonistaplanet.com/fernet/)

Great! Now you have your own xChat server. Keep in mind you will have to create new accounts whenever creating new servers. I highly recommend now building your project. I use auto-py-to-exe

For users using created servers: WARNING [THE OWNER OF A SERVER, AND ANY CONTRIBUTORS ON THEIR FIREBASE PROJECT ARE ABLE TO SEE THE PASSWORDS, AND USERNAMES OF YOUR ACCOUNTS USING THEIR ENCRYPTION KEY]

## How do I contribute?

You can contribute in anyway, just write some code and create a request. When contributing there are only 2 rules.

1 - You must be respectful to other peoples code, and respect the work they put into it.
2 - You must make your code cleanly, it should be easy to see what is going on inside it. Look at how the packages, and files are configured for how it works.
